## Homework 1

To run the code, execute the following command:

```sh
.HW_1/run.sh
```

We use a venv to run the code, so you need to activate the venv before running the code.

run.sh will run the code and generate the output files in the output folder.
So check the output folder for the output files and the query to use to get the output.
