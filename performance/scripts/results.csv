75,6,"Here's a breakdown of why the table might not be highly relevant to the query and the resulting score:* **Limited Focus:** The table seems to present results for a specific experiment (tabl 2 result on the 20 unseen test categories). It doesn't offer a broad overview of different handwritten text recognition approaches.* **Jargon:** Terms like epe, acc 005, and f3d suggest a technical focus on specific metrics or algorithms within a particular system, rather than discussing various methods generally.* **Missing Context:**  We need more information about the experiment's context (the specific model used, type of handwritten text, etc.) to understand its relevance to broader approaches.**Therefore:**0.2",false
