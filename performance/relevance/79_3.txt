Here's an analysis of the table's relevance to the query:

**Relevance:** The table seems to describe the results of a study on "Visual Question Answering (VQA)" using a dataset called "testdev".  Scene understanding is a subfield of computer vision, and VQA tasks often involve understanding scenes to answer questions. 

**Score:** Given this connection, I'd rate the relevance as **0.6 | true**. 


**Explanation:**

* **Positive Factors:** The table deals with a task (VQA) that relies on scene understanding.
* **Negative Factors:**  The table doesn't explicitly mention "techniques" for scene understanding. It focuses more on presenting results rather than outlining methods.
