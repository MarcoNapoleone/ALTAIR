The table appears to describe a specific training setup for a machine learning model, focusing on weights and datasets. Federated learning is a decentralized approach to training models across multiple devices,  and while the table touches on "training", it lacks direct information about the challenges inherent in federated learning applications (e.g., privacy concerns, communication overhead, heterogeneity of data).
