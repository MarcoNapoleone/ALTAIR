**Explanation:**

The table discusses various regression and classification approaches ("linear regress lasso regress logist regress"), which could be indirectly relevant to handwritten text recognition tasks that often involve classification (recognizing characters) or regression (estimating character positions). However, the table lacks explicit mention of handwritten text recognition. The "ijcnn1 data" reference might hint at a dataset related to image recognition, but it's not conclusive.
