Here's a breakdown of why the table might not be highly relevant to the query and the resulting score:

* **Limited Focus:** The table seems to present results for a specific experiment ("tabl 2 result on the 20 unseen test categories"). It doesn't offer a broad overview of different handwritten text recognition approaches.

* **Jargon:** Terms like "epe," "acc 005," and "f3d" suggest a technical focus on specific metrics or algorithms within a particular system, rather than discussing various methods generally.

* **Missing Context:**  We need more information about the experiment's context (the specific model used, type of handwritten text, etc.) to understand its relevance to broader approaches.


**Therefore:**
