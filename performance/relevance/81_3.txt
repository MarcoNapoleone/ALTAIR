0.4|True 

**Explanation:**

The table mentions "method" and "evalut result by our propos method", suggesting a discussion of techniques (methods) used for evaluation in scene understanding.  

However, the table doesn't provide specific details about the techniques themselves. It lacks information on algorithms, architectures, or data used for scene understanding. Therefore, while there is some relevance, it's not a highly informative source for learning about specific techniques.
